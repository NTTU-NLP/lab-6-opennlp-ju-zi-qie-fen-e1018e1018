Re: Introduce yourself here!
May 2015



@Sophie-RO haha I was wondering when it was coming, but with all the amazing things in May!

 
<OL>
<LI><SPAN>Well...
I also found it on the internet but I cannot remember how or why.
But I'm glad I did! </SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN>At the moment (Thanks to the Percy Jackson series (and Heroes of Olympus)) I've been getting really into Greek and Roman time periods.
When I was in Rome, I was disappointed with how much catholicism there was, I was looking forward to the gods but still amazing!
Although I'd probably die in my teen years, it'd still be awesome!</SPAN></LI>
<LI>What are you proud of?
Lots of things really, you guys, my family, myself.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN>I have a couple of bedrooms at the moment, and a couple more coming but I will use my current one.
1- A cluttered desk.
2- A weird, couch/seat thing.
3-(windows open)mountains.
4- clothes in piles on the floor.
5- My laptop.
6- a bed.
7- A stool.
8- a rug.
9- A full bin.
10- Me if you're lucky.
Smiley Very Happy</SPAN></LI>
<LI>What relationship are you grateful for today?
My guest family.
We're not related by blood but they still treat me like family and I am grateful for that.</LI>
<LI><SPAN>Only three?
Well, some of you know me pretty well I think.
One- I think I'll go with unique, it's the best word I can use to describe my weirdness, impulsiveness, and my somewhat brash honesty.
Then there is kind, my friends would laugh but that's because they don't see it, not really.
And... trustworthy.
I'm an excellent secret keeper.
</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN>Theme songs, classics from Star Wars, Avatar(Aang and Korra), Transformers(Bayverse and originals), a bunch of classical piano songs.
A few good, energtic ones from Disney and a bunch of recordings of rain and storms andbackground noise kinds of things.
Nature music.
Quiet forests, rainy days, stormy days, mountain mornings, ect.
Oh and a few, really old classic songs that are loud and energetic that would get everyone up and dancing in the good old days before all this recent pop came in.</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN>One?
Only one?
Can I... please... have a couple more?
Because there's free comic book day, Star Wars Day (May the fourth be with you, always), Ace Day(May 8th-May the Ace because puns are awesome), Meet the Aro(May 15th, for aromantics)...
I had a week holidays in May this year.
Oh and this year it ends on a Sunday, which is a nice conclusion to the month.
(because saying Sundays start the week is just sad since it's also the week end and having the start of the week at the weekend instead of after... just no.)</SPAN></LI>
